    <h1>What is a program?</h1><br>
    <h2>Program is a set of instructions given to a computer in a specific programming language to perform a specific task eg. html, css, bootstrap </h2><br>

    <h1>What is programming </h1><br>
    <h2>Programming refers to a technological process for telling a compurter which tasks to perform in order to solve a problem. the key steps involved are <br>
        analyse the problem <br>
        code the program <br>
        debug the program <br>
        formalize the solution <br>
        document the program <br>
        maintain the program <br>
    </h2>

    <h1>Types of programming languages </h1><br>

    <h2>High level and Low level programming languages <br>
        high level programming language are easy to understand, debug and are widely used today. they are protable and do not depend on machines. <br>
        low level languages are machine friendly, difficult to understand and are not portable. they are machine-dependent and not commonly used for programming today. <br>
    
    </h2><br>

    <h1>World Wide Web & How Internet Works</h1><br>
    <h2>The internet is a global system of computer networks interconnected through telecommunications and optical networking. www is a global collection of cocuments and other resources, linked by hyperllinks and url's. data is sent over internet is called a message, but before message get sent, they are broken up into tinier parts called packets. these messages and packets travel from one source to the next using internet protocol and transport control protocol. Clients are the devices that request and use the services provided by the servers, such as web browsing, emails etc. servers are the devices that offer and deliver the services to the clients, such as web hosting, email processing and file storage etc.</h2><br>

    <h1>Network Layers on Client and Server</h1><br>

    <h2>it consists of 7 layers. physical, data link and network transport, session presentation and application. each layer has a specific responsibilities and interacts with the layers directly above and below it. the tcp/ip model defines how devices should transmit data between them and enables communicaion over networks and large distances.  </h2>

    <h1>Client and Servers</h1><br>
    <h2>Client is a computer capable of receiving information or using a particular service form the service providers. server is a remote computer that provides information or access to a particular services. </h2><br>

    <h1>Types of Internet Connections</h1><br>
    <h2>3 types of internet connectins are wifi, broadband, dsl and cable </h2><br>
    <h2>difference between fiber optic and broadband is <br>
    fiber optic is a type of broadband connection but the fiber used is of thin glass or plastic to transmit data and so it offeres faster speeds and lower latency compared to other type of connections. </h2><br>

    <h1> Protocol </h1><br>
    <h2>the protocol by which data is sent from one computer to another on the internet. <br>
    types of protocols <br>
ARP - address Resolution protocol <br>
http - hyper text transfer protocol <br>
ip - internet protocol <br>
smtp - simple mail transfer protocol <br>
tcp - transport control protocol <br>
udp - user datagram protocol </h2><br>

<h1>difference between http and https </h1><br>
<h2>http does not encrypt the information transmitted between the client and server, making it susceptible to interception and tamering. <br>
https encrypts the data using ssl ie secure sockets layer or tls ie transport layer security protocols ensuring that the information remains secure during transmission. <br></h2>

<h1>Application security </h1><br>
<h2>the process of developing, adding, and testing security features within applications to prevent security vulnerabilities against threats such as unauthorized access and modification. </h2><br>

<h1>common vulnerabilities are <br></h1>
<h2>1. xss - the concept of xss is to manuiplate client side scripts of a web apllication to execute in the manner desired by the attacker <br>
2. injection - injection attack occurs when a hacker conducts an unvalidated input to a web application. <br>
3. security misconfiguration - it occurs when default configrations are not properly secured or customized. <br></h2>

<h1>possible solutions </h1>
<h2>1. execute input validations <br>
2. use strong encryption algorithms <br>
3. regular updating and patching the software for highly effective way to prevent vulnerabilities. </h2><br>

<h1>role of encryption in securing applications, software applications and its types </h1><br>
<h2>the role of data encryption is it helps to protect people's privacy, and secures data from attackers and other cybersecurity threats. <br>
    types of software applications <br>
    1. application software <br>
    2. system software <br>
    3. programming software <br>
    4. driver software 
</h2> <br>
<h1>examples for system software and  application software </h1><br>
<h2>microsoft word -- application software <br>
database -- application software <br>
vlc player -- application software <br>
google chrome -- application software <br>
linux -- system software <br>
accounting software -- system software <br>
android -- system software <br></h2>

<h1>difference between application software and system software <br></h1>
<h2>application is a software that fulfills a specific need or performs tasks. system software is designed to run a compuputer's hardware and provides a platform for applications to run on top of .</h2><br>

<h1>software architecture <br></h1>
<h2>It is the set of structures needed to reason about a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. it comprises of elements, relations among them and properties of both elements and relations. <br> Modularity in software engineering refers to the design approach that emphasises the separation of conccers, where a complex software systme is divided into smaller, loosely coupled modules. each module performs a specific function or handles a particular feature and they interact through well defined interfaces.  </h2><br>

<h1>Layers in Software Architecture <br></h1>

<h2>there are five main layers in software architecture. <br>
    1. presentation layer <br>
    2. application layer <br>
    3. Business layer <br>
    4. Persistence layer <br>
    5. Database layer <br>

    importance of layers :- when you divide an application into layers, it becomes easier to work on them as individual units, rather than as one large complex system. this type of process means that you can develop the entire application more effectively. 
</h2><br>

<h1>software enviroment <br></h1>
<h2>it is a collection of programs, libraries, and utilities that allow users to perform specific tasks. <br>
some types of it environments are <br>
1. operational environment <br>
2. development environment <br>
3. test environments <br>
4. production environments <br>

importance of development environment is to enhances developer efficiency and ensures proper software quality. it helps in streamlining workflows, thereby minimizing the chances of errors, and enables effective management. <br></h2>

<h1>Source code <br></h1>
<h2>Source code is a group of instructions a programmer writes using computer programming languages. once a programmer writes a line or set of source code, they can later implement it in the website, application or another type of computer program to give it instructions for functioning. <br></h2>


<h1>Difference between machine code and source code </h1><br>
<h2>Machine is code is tedious and error prone to read and write. it makes harder for the humans to understand the machine code <br></h2>

<h1>Github and instructions </h1><br>
<h2></h2>

<h1>Why is version control important in software development?</h1> <br>
<h2>version control software facilitates coordination, sharing and collaboration across the entire software deelopment team. </h2>

<h1>benefits of using Github for students</h1><br>
<h2>using github for your projects is a practical way to collaborate with others and build a protfolio that showcases real world experience. everyone with a github account can collaborate in unlimited public and private repositories with github for free. </h2><br>

<h1>Types of Software</h1><br>
<h2>the 3 types of software  <br> 
    1. system software ie are linux, operating system, windows <br>
    2. utility software ie disc cleaner, antivirus, file compression <br>
    3. application software  ie chrome, ms office, coreldraw  <br></h2>

<h1>differences between open-source and proprietary software</h1><br>
<h2>open source software is distributed with its source code, and lets user freely inspect, modify, and enhance it per its licensing agreement, while proprietary software is the copyrighted property of an individual or company that limits its use, distribution, and modification by way of a proprietary license. </h2><br>

<h1>How does GIT improve collaboration in a software development team</h1><br>
<h2>by allowing deelopers to work in parallel on different branches, git enables teams to collaborate more effectively without the risk of overwriting each other's changes. the use of pull requests or merge requests, available through platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, has further improved collaboration. <br></h2>

<h1>Role of application software</h1><br>
<h2>information management, project management, financial accounting, document management, efficiency improvements, business process management, communication, cost reduction </h2><br>

<h1>various types of application software </h1><br>
<h2>word processing software, graphics software, spreadsheet software, presentation software, web browsers <br></h2>

<h1>Software Development Process</h1><br>
<h2>software development process is the approach to developing, and deliering software applications. this process might include improving design and product management by splitting the work into smaller steps or processes. <br></h2>

<h1>main stages of the software development process</h1><br>
<h2>the main stages are <br>
gathering and analysis of requirement <br>
Design <br>
Coding / implementation <br>
Testing <br>
Deployment stage <br>
Maintenance <br></h2>

<h1>Software Requirement</h1><br>
<h2>it is a condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective. a condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification or other formally imposed document. <br></h2>

<h1> requirement specification for a simple library management system<br></h1>
<h2>ability to search for books in the library by title, author or ISBN. ability to chech out and return books. ability to display a list of all books in the library. ability to store and retrieve information about library patrons, including their name and id number. <br></h2>

<h1>Why is the requirement analysis phase critical in software development</h1><br>
<h2>as its the base of the total software development </h2><br>

<h1>role of software analysis in the development process <br></h1>
<h2>software analysis and design is a process of understanding the requirements of a software system and then designing a system that meets those requirements. it involves gathering and analyzing user requirements , creating a system architecture, and designing the individual components of the system. <br></h2>

<h1>key elements of system design</h1><br>
<h2>4basic elements to the system model is output, process, input and feedback <br></h2>

<h1>Why is software testing important?<br></h1>
<h2>software testing is imperative as it identifies any issues and defects with the written code os they can be fixed before the software product is delivered. <br></h2>

<h1>types of software maintenance are there</h1>
<h2>software maintenance can be classified into 4 types. <br>
corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive maintenance. </h2><br>

<h1>key differences between web and desktop applications?</h1><br>
<h2>desktop apps do not require an internet connection to run. web apps cannot run without an internet connection. they are accessible only in the machine they are installed in. they are accessible from anywhere and through any device with an intenet connection and a web browser. <br></h2>

<h1>What are the advantages of using web applications over desktop applications</h1><br>
<h2>the main advantages of web applications are <br>
no software installation, automatic update, cross platform compatibillity, light on system resources, 24/7 access to data, better user interfaces, potential for integration, scalability. <br></h2>

<h1>role does UI/UX design play in application development <br></h1>
<h2>the value of ui/ux design lies in its ability to help businesses solve real problems for real people using digital products. similar to software testing, ui/ux design focuses on creating great quality user experiences at every stage of the quality driven development cycle. <br></h2>

<h1>e differences between native and hybrid mobile apps</h1><br>
<h2>in a native app, developers have to rewrite and redesign all the app functionality in the native development language. a hybrid app lets uou write the app functionality in a single codebase. you can then wrap your code in a lightweight natie app shell or container. <br>
hybrid app can function on both the android and ios operating system, while, the native app of similar type and quality can only run on either platform. since the average gybrid app is platform-versatile, its developers can launch it on both goole play and the apple app store. <br></h2>

<h1>significance of DFDs in system analysis</h1><br>
<h2>dfd's help you better understand process or system operations to discover potential problems, improe efficiency, and develop better processes. they range from simple overviews to complex granular displays of a process or system. <br></h2>

<h1>pros and cons of desktop applications compared to web applications</h1><br>
<h2>web and desktop applications have different strengths and weaknesses. web apps are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, while desktop apps must be installed on each user's device. desktop apps perform better, work offline, and keep data more secure. <br></h2>

<h1> : How do flowcharts help in programming and system design<br></h1>
<h2>as a visual representation of data flow, flowcharts are useful in writing a program or algorithm and explaining it to others or collaborating with them on it. you can use an algorithm flowchart to spell out the logic behind a program before ever starting to code the automated process <br></h2>
